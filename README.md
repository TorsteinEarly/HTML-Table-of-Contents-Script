- **Who:** Web Devs and Knowledge Base Article Authors
- **What:** 
  - A PowerShell Script for making HTML Table of Contents.
  - In goes a list of headings > Out goes HTML code for a Table of Content and corosponding linked/anchored Section Headings. 
  - [See this Walkthrough explaining how it works](/assets/posts/html_toc/script_kb_example)
- **Why:** 
  - It saves you time that would otherwise be spent on formatting, copying, pasting, anchoring, linking, multiple times over multiple headings. 
  - I've made a KB article template available to you so that you can share the info with others that may benefit.
  - I get to enjoy experimenting with PowerShell, learning HTML, and now learning GitHub and GitHub.oi.

- Scripts:
  - [Copy and Paste in to a PowerShell Console ](/assets/posts/html_toc/copy_and_paste)
  - [Create a Batch File](/assets/posts/html_toc/save_as_batch_file)
    - This is a PowerShell script that you will run to generate the batch file commands; The batch file requires an encoded command, so you get to encode it yourself as I believe that allows you to review the code and feel more secure. 
    - The script is essentially the encoding commands wrapped around the Copy and Paste script.
    - You would then save its output, which is copied to your computer clipboard, to a "Save as Batch File.txt" file that you can attach to the KB. Or, if you are only performing this to yourself, just save the output as a batch file.
  - [Save the functions to your PowerShell Profile](/assets/posts/html_toc/save_to_psprofile)
- Walk Through KB Article
  - [Example KB Detailing the Scripts and How to Run Them](/assets/posts/html_toc/script_kb_example)
  - [KB Template for you to save in your own KB](/assets/posts/html_toc/kb_html_template)
    - Same as the above Example KB, but raw HTML.
    - If you publish the KB article, be sure to edit it to your own institution's standards, remove any script methods you do not want to publish, and attach text files for any script methods you do want to publish.
    - I am no master of HTML, so your mileage may vary: This was generated using the TDX KB editor, which runs on Bootstrap 3.4.1. If you are having trouble making the controls work, see the [Bootstrap Basic HTML Template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/getting-started/#template) that I used to make the code work on GitHub for the [Example KB Detailing the Scripts and How to Run Them](/assets/posts/html_toc/script_kb_example)
